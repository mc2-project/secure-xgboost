Multiclient Jupyter Tutorial
############################

For RISE Camp 2020, we created a tutorial to show the collaborative aspect of Secure XGBoost. In particular, multiple clients work together to jointly train a model over their individual data. Because each party had access to only a notebook during RISE Camp, one party in the collaboration was also responsible for launching the enclave that all parties would use during computation.

You can find the tutorial and installation instructions `here <https://github.com/mc2-project/risecamp/tree/risecamp2020>`_ and a walkthrough of the tutorial `here <https://youtu.be/-kK-YCjqABs?t=312>`_.
